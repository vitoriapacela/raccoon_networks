# Raccoon Social Structure through Time
This is the repository for the Network Analysis project by Tlahui Alberto Bolaños Mejia and Vitória Barin Pacela.

We have studied a social network of raccoons and how they evolve through one year. 

- `notebooks` contains code, analyses, and plots used in the study.

- `raccoon_proximity_weighted` contains the data, distributed by the [Animal Social Network Repository](https://github.com/bansallab/asnr/tree/master/Networks/Mammalia/raccoon_proximity_weighted).

- `conda_env.sh` installs a conda virtual environment with all the package requirements.
